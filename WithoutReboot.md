### Change ID without rebooting the device
Changing ID without reboot works on **Android 10, 11, and 12**. \
A new experimental solution works on Android 10-16. 

The addon is distributed separately and costs 100 USD:

- [BTC/ETH/USDT/USDC/other](https://pay.oxapay.com/12499691)
- [buymeacoffee.com](https://bit.ly/idchangernoreboot)

The download link will be sent to the specified email after processing the transaction. Note: 
- The processing time may take up to 20 minutes
- Transactions with less than 100 USDT are processed as a purchase of the standard version of the app

After applying the new ID, the Device ID Changer makes a force-stop call on the target application, and usually, it's enough.
However, some apps can save the ID in their storage; in this case, it might be necessary to clear the app's storage.
The Device ID Changer has an option to clear an app's data after applying a new ID.
