### Change ID without rebooting the device
Changing ID without reboot works on **Android 10, 11, and 12**. \
The build is distributed separately and costs 100 USDT, and for this purchase only crypto is accepted. 

[Open payment page](https://bit.ly/idchangercrypto)

The download link will be sent to the specified email after processing the transaction. Note: 
- sometimes the processing time may take up to 20 minutes
- transactions with less than 100 USDT are processed as a purchase of the standard version of the app

After applying the new ID the Device ID Changer makes a force-stop call on the target application and usually, it's enough.
However, some apps can save the ID in their storage, in this case, it might be necessary to clear the app's storage.
The Device ID Changer has an option to clear an app's data after applying a new ID.
